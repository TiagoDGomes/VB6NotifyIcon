Old Windows
===========

This version adds a few more checks for Windows < Win2K.

BalloonShow
-----------

This version changes the BalloonShow() method to return a
Boolean result.  It returns False for OS < Win2K and skips
trying to show a balloon tip.

This makes parts of Demo.exe get "skipped" before Win2K, the
parts related to balloon tips.

Calling Shell_NotifyIcon
------------------------

In early versions of Windows (Win95 and Win98 if not Me and NT
4.0) the unicows.dll does not seem to properly "shim" calls to
Shell_NotifyIconW.  This means the calls do succeed but the
expected actions do not occur.

So now NotifyIcon.ctl uses conditional calls to either the
ANSI or the Unicode entrypoint based on the Shell version that
was detected during UserControl_Initialize.

Misc. Bugs
==========

Found at least one small bug.

ToolTip Property
----------------

Had been calling PropertyChanged in its Property Get instead
of Property Let.
